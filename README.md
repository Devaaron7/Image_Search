# Image_Search
 
This is a image scraping program that takes in a user's input and searches unsplash.com for images.

The program chooses 3 images randomly from the total collected and places them in a bin folder in the root directory where the python file is.

Finally it opens the folder so that you can view the images.

The program requires the following modules:

- bs4

- guizero
- lxml

Usage -
