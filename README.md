# Image_Search
 
This web app uses the JSON API offered by Unsplash.com to return images from the website based on a user's input.

Simply go to the website, enter in a search term & hit the search button.

You will see up to 3 images returned. You can request new results by hitting the button again.

Skills used:
- Building backend service to processing API authorization securely and reture information to frontend / client.
- Writing python code to setup the different endpoints for processing HTTP requests
- HTML / CSS code to create user friendly frontend
- Javascript to allow post request (via Ajax), from the frontend, and use for loops on the backend response to populate the images.
